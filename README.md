## Project Title:

Blackjack

## Motivation:

My motivation for Muzak was to create a service that I would like to use myself: providing personalized music recommendations to users based on their preferences. I've always enjoyed the various ways that streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify provide recommendations, so I modeled this app off of Last.fm's algorithm.
